# Deep-Learning-Project--Dog Vision
 
End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification
This notebook buils an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

New Section
1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

2. Data
The data used is from Kaggle's dog bread identification competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview

3. Evaluation
Multi-Class Log Loss: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html

4. Features
Info about data:

* Dealing with images (unstructured data) so is probably best to use deep learning/transfer learning;
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes);
* There are ~ 10,000 + images in the training set(these images have labels) and ~ 10,000 images in the test set(no labels);
